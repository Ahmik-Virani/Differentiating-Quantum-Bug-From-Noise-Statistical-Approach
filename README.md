# Differentiating Quantum Bug From Noise - A Statistical Approach

This is a github reposiratory that provides experimental proof of how one can use probabilistic measures to distinguish quantum bug from hardware noise. 

We assume familiarity with terms : Noise, Bug, Bias, Entropy, Probability Mass Functions, Most Probabile States and Desired States.

This reposiratory can be divided into 2 parts:
1. Effects of noise and bugs on bias and entropy. This consists of the following:
   - Effect of noise on Bias.ipynb
   - Effect of noise on Entropy.ipynb
   - Effect_of_bugs_on_Entropy
   - Effect_of_bugs_on_Bias
2. Case Studies
   - Case Study - Grover's Algorithm.ipynb
   - Case Study - Simon's Algorithm.ipynb
   - DJA_case_study.ipynb
